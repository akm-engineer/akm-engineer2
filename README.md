<h1 align="center">Namaste 🙏!, I'm Ashish Kumar Mishra</h1>
<h4 align="center">👋 Your friendly neighborhood MERN stack wizard. I’m like a coding ninja - MongoDB is my secret weapon, React.js is my katana, and Node.js is my throwing star. I build web apps that are not only functional but also have that “wow” factor. My code is so clean, that even my laptop screen gets jealous. Let’s connect on LinkedIn (akm-engineer) and turn your ideas into digital magic. Warning: May sprinkle a dash of humor in commit messages! 🚀😄</h4>
